      27 This answer is similar to others, but is overall the best for most
      applications. You need to know the image size before hand which you
      usually do. This will let you add overlay text, titles etc. with no
      negative padding or absolute positioning of the image. They key is to set
      the padding % to match the image aspect ratio as seen in the example
      below. I used this answer and essentially just added an image background..
